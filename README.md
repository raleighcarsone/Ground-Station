# Ground-Station

#Possible Vision Statement
/* This  team  will  work on  the 
design, fabrication, and demonstration of a microwave ground station that tracks spacecrafts. The ground station has two 
main  sub-systems:  
  (a)  Positioning  and  tracking  system,  
  (b)  microwave  receiver  and  antenna  system.  
Hardware  design 
  include the positioning system and the microwave receiver using a software defined radio (SDR). Software design includes 
  spacecraft orbit tracking algorithms, integration of the positioning and receiver software, and the graphic user interface. */
