Sept 29
Formulated SRS and SDD


Sept 16
Met with Rojas
Tour of MicaPlex and labs
Figured out hardware and radio design planning


Sept 20
Discussed subproject requirements
Hardware:
AutoCad  mount
Motor/servo testing, load testing
Assemble frame
Assemble ratcheting ports (I forget the real name)
Check power output
Software:
GUI that has 2 modes, manual and tracking 
Include mode to manually move in all 4 directions, angle + azimuth 
Have GUI show angle that dish is pointing at 
Automatic tracking mode
Should be able to select satellites manually, or pick those from a table that updates
Table that is able to “see” satellites that are in viewable range
Radio:
Link budget (s band)
Satellite output powers and frequency
Software should be able to switch/have wide enough bands to accept multiple signals (4GHz +/- ??)
Doppler frequency shift adjustments
Close-range interference/filters
