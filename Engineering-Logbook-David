Engineering Notebook

Sept 29
Formulated SRS and SDD


Sept 16
Met with Rojas
Tour of MicaPlex and labs
Figured out hardware and radio design planning


Sept 20
Discussed subproject requirements
Hardware:
AutoCad  mount
Motor/servo testing, load testing
Assemble frame
Assemble ratcheting ports (I forget the real name)
Check power output
Software:
GUI that has 2 modes, manual and tracking 
Include mode to manually move in all 4 directions, angle + azimuth 
Have GUI show angle that dish is pointing at 
Automatic tracking mode
Should be able to select satellites manually, or pick those from a table that updates
Table that is able to “see” satellites that are in viewable range
Radio:
Link budget (s band)
Satellite output powers and frequency
Software should be able to switch/have wide enough bands to accept multiple signals (4GHz +/- ??)
Doppler frequency shift adjustments
Close-range interference/filters
