Semester Break

1-12-2023
Met with the other group members to discuss what needed to be done to complete this project at the end of the semester.

1-17-2023
Met with the other group members to discuss how to accomplish the tasks discussed previously. 

1-19-2023
Met at the MicaPlex with the other member of the Radio team to plan the rigerous antenna testing.
Researched how to change our antenna into circular polarization.

1-23-2023
Did the preliminary setup for the antenna testing.
Redid the Product Vision and updated the Product Backlog to reflect the discussions previously held. 
Assisted another team member with the Doppler Frequency Shift calculations.

1-24-2023
Finished doing the Doppler Frequency Shift.
Begun designing a 90° transmission line for circular polarization.

1-26-2023
Started working on the preliminary design of the front end fitler.
Designed and simulated the Low Pass Prototype

1-30-2023
Finished designing and simulating the Low Pass Prototype.
Started and completed designing and simulating the Band Pass Prototype from the LPP.
Ran anechoic chamber testing to determine the gain and pattern of our antenna.

1-31-2023
Began designing the stepped impedance conversion of the front end filter after determining the lumped element approach was not effective.
Started working on the Sprint 4 Presentation.

2-2-2023
Ran design calculations for the stepped impedance conversion.
Finished Sprint 4 Presentation.

2-6-2023
Used ADS to simulate the stepped impedance filter.
Ran simulations to test the filter response.
Redid calculations because the filter response did not meet our requirements.

2-7-2023
Used ADS to design and simulate the 90° transmission line for circular polorization.
Presented Sprint 4 presentation.

2-9-2023
Finished design calculations for coupled line filter to increase effectiveness. 
Used ADS to simulate the coupled lined filter's response.
Used LPKF U4 to mill the coupled line filter.
Did maintence on the LPKF U4 to try and get it opperational again.

2-13-2023
Continued to try and troubleshoot the LPKF U4.
Contacted LPKF customer support in an attempt to get the mill running again.

2-14-2023
Implemented the maintenence suggestions provided by the customer support technition.
Ordered the components required to fix the LPKF U4.

2-16-2023
Since we are unable to mill, my focus shifted to the GNU.
Conducted research into proper GNU protocol and downloaded GNU Radio Companion.

2-21-2023
Conducted research into proper GNU protocol.
Coded a preliminary prototype to familiarize myself with GNU Radio Companion.

2-23-2023
Followed the tutorials created by GNU Radio Companion posted online.

2-27-2023
Finished the tutorials created by GNU Radio Companion posted online.
Coded a prototype GNU using the skills learned from the tutorials.

2-28-2023
Worked on the Test Plan submission for this sprint.

3-2-2023
Finalized the Test Plan and added all of the Radio team test work.

3-6-2023
Assisted with the rest of the documentation due at the end of this week.

3-7-2023
Attempted to troubleshoot the LPKF under the instructions of the LPKF technition.

3-9-2023
Replaced the motor filter on the LPKF to see if that was casuing the issue.
Tried using a sealant to fix the low pressure inside the table of the LPKF.

3-20-2023
I was able to fix the LPFK.
Started to manufacuter the Bandpass Filter.

3-21-2023
Completed manufacturing the Coupled Line Bandpass Filter.
Manufactured the 90° phase shift transmission line.

3-23-2023
Soldered sma connectors to the Coupled Line Bandpass Filter and to the 90° phase shift transmission line.
Began testing the Coupled Line Bandpass Filter.

3-27-2023
Finished testing the Coupled Line Bandpass Filter, it passed spectaularly.
There were some issues with the soldering because the filter substrate was too narrow.
Tested the 90° phase shift transmission line, it failed misserably.

3-28-2023
Started redesign of the filter board to increase soldering effectiveness.

3-30-2023
Finalized filter redesign and added increased soldering functionality.

4-3-2023
Complete redesign of the transmission line is needed. Discussed with David the different approaches.

4-4-2023
Our options are to extend the ground plane to try and force a transmission, design manufacture and test a power divider with a phase shift, or cut a coax cable that achieves the desired phase shift.

4-6-2023
Conducted a feasablilty analysis on the above options. 
We decided to attempt another transmission line while taking into account the length of the sma connector for a more accurate phase shift.
