Semester Break

1-12-2023
Met with the other group members to discuss what needed to be done to complete this project at the end of the semester.

1-17-2023
Met with the other group members to discuss how to accomplish the tasks discussed previously. 

1-19-2023
Met at the MicaPlex with the other member of the Radio team to plan the rigerous antenna testing.
Researched how to change our antenna into circular polarization.

1-23-2023
Did the preliminary setup for the antenna testing.
Redid the Product Vision and updated the Product Backlog to reflect the discussions previously held. 
Assisted another team member with the Doppler Frequency Shift calculations.
